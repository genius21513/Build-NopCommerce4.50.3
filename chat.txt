nopcommerce development for auto parts website, the site must be able to search by year, make and model , and search by VIN. the data source is called via API real-time to get the product list and category.
Also required to develop the templated looks professional.





can not get all data from API as it will have too many data and the data will changes from data source provider.

can you do similar design or better as I send you earlier and intergrate with nop comm, I think when customer place the order, the same time you will insert product data in the system

call time no an issues

we are trying to only save the product data when user's place the order


when you completed the project , I need you also provide the source code upload into Freelander

can you take the design UI too?

2000-3000
Pls provide scope of work
